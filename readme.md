# Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis
Hello! This is a multi-label classification model designed to detect the 20 vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

# Overview
- Collected Smart Contracts address and their vulnerability labels (20 vulnerabilities)
- Used Beautiful Soup to scrape Smart Contracts context and used solidity-parser to parse solidity files, generating Abstract Syntax Trees (AST).
- Applied BFS on AST to create custom objects and transformed them into structured string sequences using DFS.
- Processed sequences as inputs, augmented the distillBERT vocabulary, training a multi-label classification model based on distillBERT.
- Used the model to successfully predict vulnerability multi-labels in Smart Contracts, achieving a Hamming Score of 0.827.
